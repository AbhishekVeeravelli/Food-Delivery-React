Description about React
Parcel
Dev build
Local Server
Automatically refreshing the page=>HMR(Hard Module Replacement)
Parcel uses the file watching algorithm and written in c++
Caching-Faster builds
Image optimization
Minification of file
Bundling
Compress the files
Consistent hashing
Code splitting
Differential bundling-It makes app run smoothly in th older browsers as well
Diagnostics behind the scene
Error Handling
Helps in host the website in https
Tree Shaking algorithm- Removes unused code for you
Different bundlers for dev and prod
Read parcel documentation for more info

--> In react there are two types of export and import

--> 1st type is default export/import

export default Component import component from "path"

-->2nd type is named export/import

export const Component; import {Component} from "path"

#React Hooks It is a normal JS function which is a utility function which give you the utilities

They are normal JS functions

UseState()-- This is used to generate super powerful state to react variables
UseEffect()-- UseEffect is used after every render of that component
Using dependency array is not mandatory. But when we call the useEffect without a dependency array it renders everytime the component is rendered

If dependency array is empty = []=>useEffect is called on initial render(just once)
If we put something in the dependency array it will be only called when the dependency changes
If dependency array is [btnNameReact] then useEffect is called everytime btnNameReact is updated
Router provider provides the routing configuration to the app
To identify a hook the common convention in the industry is to find for "use"
React is a single page application.The reason behind this is it follows Client Side Routing. In Client Side Routing whenever the home page is loaded it gets the code for all the other pages and when we switch the tabs aas the applications is already loaded it display the pages without delay/latency.
There are two types of routing in any web application
Client Side Routing
Server Side Routing:
React lifecycle if there is only one component

Parent Constructor

Parent Render

Child1 Constructor

Child1 Render

Child1 ComponenDidMount

Parent ComponentDidMount

React lifecycle if there are two components

Parent Constructor
Parent Render
------Render Phase---------

Child1 Constructor

Child1 Render

Child2 Constructor

Child2 Render

------------Commit Phase-----------------

Child1 ComponenDidMount

Child2 ComponenDidMount

Parent ComponentDidMount

The reason behind the React is batching up the commit phase when having more than two children is to optimize the execution. This is because when commit phase starts React updates the DOM and we know that DOM manipulation is the expensive thing in updating the component.

-----MOUNTING--------

Constructor(dummy)
Render(dummy)
ComponentDidMount
API call
this.setState (state variable is updated)
--------Update Cycle---------

render(API data)
HTML is loaded with API data
ComponentDidiUpdate
Dynamic Bundling
Lazy loading
Code Splitting
Chunking
On demand Loading
The funda of all this names is to split the application in logical bundles to minimize the size of the application. If we have multiple components we can make each component as a each bundle and deploy

Controlled and Uncontrolled Components
When a parent controls the child component then it is called Controlled Component
------------------------------------------------------REDUX-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Redux Toolkit
Redux store is a big java script object and it is kept in a golbal central space

So Redux has multiple slices inside it where each slice is a component for example the slices are cart,user,etc.

We cannot dirctly use a slice. Let's say we want to modify a cart slice it can be modified using a dispatch action which calls a reducer function then the function internally updates the cart slice inside the redux object. This function is basically known as reducer. This operation is known as writing data

To Read data from the slice we use "selector". This selector will modify the react component. Here the selector will modify the store component that means it updates the count of items in store. This phenomenon is called as "Subscribing to the Store"

Install Redux tool kit(@reduxjs/toolkit) and react-redux

Build our own store

Connect store to the app

Create card slice

Dispatch(action)

Selector

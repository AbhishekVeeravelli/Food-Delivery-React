🍽️ Food Ordering App — React Project

A modern, responsive food ordering application built while learning React from scratch. This project demonstrates core React concepts, routing, state management, Redux Toolkit, and efficient bundling using Parcel.

🚀 Features

🔍 Search restaurants

🍱 Restaurant cards with name, rating, cuisine, delivery time

🖼️ Image rendering & dynamic UI

🧭 Client-side routing for navigation

🛒 Add to cart (Redux)

📄 Reusable components for Header, Footer, and Body

⚡ Fast development with Parcel (HMR, bundling, optimization

 🛠️ Tech Stack

React.js

React Router

Redux Toolkit

Parcel Bundler

JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, CSS

📚 What I Learned (High-Level Summary)
🌿 React Fundamentals

JSX, Components, Props, State

Controlled vs Uncontrolled components

React lifecycle (mount → update → unmount)

Hooks:

useState – state management

useEffect – side effects & dependency arrays

🧭 Routing

Client-side routing using React Router Provider

SPA behavior (no full page reloads)

⚙️ Parcel (Bundler)

Parcel provides:

⚡ HMR (Hot Module Replacement)

⚡ Fast dev server

📦 Bundling & minification

🧹 Tree shaking

🧩 Code splitting

📤 Automatic HTTPS

🖼️ Image optimization

⏱️ Caching for faster builds

🗂️ Redux Toolkit

Central store with multiple slices (cart, user, etc.)

dispatch() → update store through reducers

useSelector() → subscribe to store changes

Clean, structured state management

🏗️ Key Concepts Implemented
🔄 Component Lifecycle

Mounting → Rendering → Commit → Update
Handled API calls inside useEffect.

🧩 Code Splitting & Lazy Loading

Dynamic import

On-demand loading for optimized performance

▶️ Getting Started
1️⃣ Install dependencies
npm install

2️⃣ Start development server
npm start

3️⃣ Build for production
npm run build

📦 Deployment

The project can be deployed using:

Netlify
